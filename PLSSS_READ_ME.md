# minecraft_noties
This is an itty bitty code for a Discord bot that reads the latest logs of a running Minecraft server and sends notifications to a discord channel on what is happening in the Minecraft server. For example if someone dies, and in the logs it says "was slain by|fell from|drowned|burned to death|hit the ground too hard" it will detect this and the bot will send the line to the channel for everyone to read. It also reads when people join with "joined the game", when someone made an achivement "has made" and when someone leaves the game with "left the game". Additionally it notifies the people in the channel that the server has been turned on or off with "Done \(\d+\.\d+s\)! For help, type "help"" for on and when the server has been shut down with "ThreadedAnvilChunkStorage: All dimensions are saved". That is all, thanks if you read. *You can edit all you want ;)*
