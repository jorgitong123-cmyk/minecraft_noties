How to Implement and setup Server

Step 1:

Add all files to a folder...

Step 2: 

Add a .jar file to the same folder. 
example: Spigot-1.21.5.jar or Paper-1.21.4.jar

Step 3: 

Copy the name of the .jarfile onto the start.bat file. 
Alocate the amount of memory you want and run the start.bat.

Step 4:

Open the EULA.txt file that generates and replace "false" with "true"

Step 5: 

Now that the logs file is generated, place the location of the file in the noties_watcher.cmd file. example: E:\2025 Server\watch_log.ps1

Step 6: Probably the most tedious and annoying part.

Create a Discord Webhook by going into a channel, 
integrations and webhooks. Go to "Webhook"
Name it and copy its "URL" in the configuratiosn tab of 
watch_log.ps1.
